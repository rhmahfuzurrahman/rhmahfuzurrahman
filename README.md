## 👋 Hi, I'm Mahfuzur Rahman

**Cybersecurity Architect** specializing in **Zero Trust, Cloud Security, and Identity-centric Architecture**.

I design security systems that reduce blast radius, enforce least privilege, and remain auditable at scale.

### How to read this GitHub

This GitHub is not a collection of code samples.  
It reflects how I think about **security architecture** in real enterprise environments.

You’ll find:
- Architecture patterns and reference designs
- Identity, access, network, and platform security models
- Security design mapped to risk, scale, and auditability
- Practical notes drawn from real-world systems

Each repository focuses on *design intent, trade-offs, and architectural decisions* rather than tools or implementations.
